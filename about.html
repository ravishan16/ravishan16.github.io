                <h2 id="bio-heading" class="sr-only">Detailed Biography</h2> <p>I’m Ravishankar Sivasubramaniam—Ravi to most—a technologist with over two decades of hands-on engineering experience, a knack for automation, and a passion for building high-performing teams and systems. My story begins in the late 1990s in India, where as a teenager I taught myself BASIC, UNIX, and C during high school. That curiosity led me to pursue a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering at Kumaraguru College of Technology (1999–2003). There, I honed my skills in Assembly, HDL, Verilog, and MATLAB, while also diving into self-taught web development—building HTML, JavaScript, and CSS websites for small businesses and hosting them on GeoCities. Those early projects were my first taste of product creation and sparked a lifelong drive to solve real-world problems with technology.</p>

                <h3>2003–2012: NTT DATA (Caritor/Keane) – Full-Stack to Data Engineering</h3>
                <p>My professional career launched in 2003 when I joined Caritor (later acquired by Keane and then NTT DATA) through campus placement. Starting as a full-stack developer, I built web applications using Java, JSP, JavaScript, and Oracle databases, alongside reporting tools like Crystal Reports. Early projects included web solutions for Honeywell Friction Materials and Garrett (France), where I handled everything from requirements to deployment. By 2005, I was a Lead Consultant at Hyster-Yale Group, rolling out an e-commerce Configurator with Java, SQL Server, and Actuate Reports—a system that streamlined order management.</p>
                <p>From 2006–2008, I shifted to data engineering at Honeywell in Phoenix, leading the development of SAP Business Objects Rapid Marts for SAP ECC integration. I leaned into ETL tools like Informatica and deepened my database expertise with Oracle. Then, from 2008–2012, as a Business Intelligence Consultant at CSX, I built reporting and analytics pipelines using Informatica, SSIS, Essbase, and Business Objects. Over these nine years, I transitioned from full-stack coding to data warehousing, laying the foundation for my future in large-scale systems.</p>

                <h3>Scaling Data Systems (2012–2018)</h3>
                <p>After earning my Master’s in Computer and Information Sciences from the University of North Florida (2010–2013), I joined Aetna in Chicago as a Data Warehouse Architect (2012-2014). Leading a team of 20+ developers, I architected and migrated over 1,000 Informatica ETL pipelines from Oracle to Netezza—a high-performance, vertically scaled database. This role sharpened my skills in distributed data processing and team leadership.</p>
                <p>In 2014, I joined NielsenIQ in Chicago as a Solutions Architect (2014-2018), where I spent four years building a cloud-based machine learning platform. Using Hadoop, Spark, Python, Java, and Scala, I designed frameworks to harmonize massive datasets, empowering data scientists and developers. I led the platform’s transition from on-prem Hadoop to AWS and Azure, integrating Docker, Jenkins, Airflow, and Elastic Search for scalability and automation. My focus on CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code transformed the team’s culture into a DevOps-driven powerhouse. Mentoring colleagues and scaling solutions, I stayed hands-on—coding APIs in Flask and optimizing with Pandas and NumPy—while leading multi-million-dollar initiatives.</p>

                <h3>ML, Startups, and Strategy (2018–Present)</h3>
                <p>In June 2018, I joined American Tire Distributors (ATD) in North Carolina as a Senior Machine Learning Architect. Reporting to the C-suite, I led the engineering arm of an advanced analytics team, collaborating with PhD data scientists to save hundreds of millions through optimization models—route planning, profit analysis, and slotting. I built and deployed 10+ production-grade applications using Python, Flask, and Google Cloud Platform (App Engine, BigQuery, Cloud SQL), weaving in CI/CD with Jenkins, Terraform, and GitHub Actions.</p>
                <p>In 2020, I transitioned to Torqata, an ATD startup subsidiary, as a founding Lead Solutions Architect. Growing the team from 10 to 50+, I architected a data platform to tackle tire industry challenges, leveraging cloud infrastructure, machine learning, and analytics. My hands-on leadership—coding, optimizing, and automating—ensured we delivered enterprise-ready solutions fast.</p>
                <p>Since March 2022, I’ve been a Director/Principal at Fannie Mae in Washington, D.C., working in corporate functions and reporting to senior leadership. I’ve rolled out Workday HCM, upgraded benefits SaaS integrations (e.g., Salesforce, Zapier), and shaped corporate data strategy with a focus on PII security. Leading Generative AI initiatives, I’m driving proofs of concept to rewrite legacy applications, optimize infrastructure, and modernize workflows with AI agents—using my expertise in code optimization and distributed systems. I’ve established model governance frameworks, streamlined SaaS procurement, and created reusable architectural patterns. Mentoring a team of architects and developers, I remain hands-on—automating with Python, Terraform, and cloud-native tools—while leading multi-million-dollar projects.</p>

                <h3>Beyond the Day Job: Consulting and Mentorship</h3>
                <p>Beyond corporate roles, I’ve consulted pro bono for small companies, helping them automate workflows, set up CRMs (Salesforce, Copper), and build e-commerce portals with Shopify and WooCommerce. Using Python, Zapier, and n8n, I’ve integrated systems and stood up secure tech stacks—skills honed across big enterprises, startups, and consulting gigs.</p>

                <h3>Who I Am as a Technologist</h3>
                <p>My strongest technical skills lie in building high-performing teams, machine learning platforms, distributed data processing systems, and data-driven web applications. I’m an automation fanatic—crafting enterprise-grade CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and secure cloud/on-prem networking. I rewrite legacy apps, optimize code, and bridge old and new tech with pragmatism. Whether leading 50+ person teams or coding as an individual contributor, I’ve worked in enterprises of all sizes and startups, always staying hands-on-keys. With humility, I embrace my wide-ranging capabilities—rooted in exceptional engineering and a relentless drive to deliver.</p>
                <p>Currently i am vibe coding, been running llm locally, have built several side projects usign AI agents to test out capabilities to automate things around me.</p>
